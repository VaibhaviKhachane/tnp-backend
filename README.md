The web application provides the three distinct modules as students, TPO, and Company to manage the placements data. Students can register themselves on the web portal with their academic details and apply from the same portal to campus placements. All the data related to students and companies are available to the college's TPO officer. Companies can connect with colleges and be able to arrange multiple drives in the same college and manage their data for a particular college.
